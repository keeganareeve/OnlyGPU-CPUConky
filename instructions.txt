#
#
#
# [One time commands:]
#
# Make directory for custom configs (if not made already).
#
mkdir ~/.conf/conky
#
# Copy file from this folder to use custom config file
# ("[...]" depends where you cloned this folder).  
#
cp [...]/conky.conf ~/.config/conky
#
# Copy file from the default files to restore (if needed).
#
cp /etc/conky/conky.conf ~/.config/conky
#
#
#
# [Commands to use everytime
# (unless conky's set to start with computer's start up):]
#
# Go into new conky directory.
#
cd ~/.config/conky
#
# Run conky with new config file!
#
conky -dbc conky.conf
#
# OR
#
conky -dbc ~/.config/conky/conky.conf
